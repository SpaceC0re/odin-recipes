    <h2>Simple Japanese dish made up of a rice ball wrapped in algae</h2>
    <p>The Onigiri is an easy recipe where we'll fill a ball of rice with meat or fish and wrap it in algae</p>

    <h2>Ingredients (Tuna and cucumber Onigiri) :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams of Japanese rice</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of rice vinegar</li>
        <li>One can of tuna</li>
        <li>One piece of cucumber approximately 6cm in length</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Nori algae</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the rice : Soak the rice for 1 hour in cold water. Drain the rice and let it sit for 30 minutes in a strainer. </li>
        <li>In a cooking pot, add the rice along with 20cl of water.</li>
        <li>Let the rice cook on medium heat, and cover the pot when water starts boiling. Cook for 5 minutes without removing the cover, then lower the heat and let cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the stove without removing the cover and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the rice in a bowl and add the rice vinegar. Let the preparation cool at ambient temperature.</li>
        <li>Cut the cucumber in tiny pieces and add the tuna. Mix them with soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Humidify your hands in cold water. Take a 50g ball of rice and pack it tight with your hands. Make a small hole in the center and add some of the tuna filling, then close the rice ball around it.</li>
        <li>Shape the rice ball into a triangle.</li>
        <li>Wrap the rice triangle with algae.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with more rice and more filling.</li>
